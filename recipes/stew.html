        <li>Pour wine into the pot and scrape up any browned bits off the bottom of the pot. Cook until wine is reduced by half, 3 to 5 minutes. Place carrots and potatoes on top of onions.

        <li>Unlock and remove lid. Switch to Saute function. Stir potato starch mixture into the stew; cook until thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
